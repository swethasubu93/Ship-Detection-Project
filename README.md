# Object Detection 
### Overview
Building a Objection Detection model that can predict the location of a ship in a given satellite image. 
Using a given a set of images for which the location of the ships are provided, the model was trained on this data and used to predict the location of ships on test data.

### Model
A U-Net model is built and IOU evaluation metric is used- which is ideal of object detection cases.
